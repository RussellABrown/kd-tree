This Github repository comprises the source files “kdTreeKnlogn.cpp” and “kdTreeNlogn.cpp”
that are C++ implementations of the k-d tree-building algorithms described in the online
articles

http://www.jcgt.org/published/0004/01/03/

https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5420

The arXiv article includes an appendix that describes improvements to the two k-d
tree-building algorithms relative to the description published in the Journal of
Computer Graphics Techniques article in 2015.
